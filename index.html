                    Junior Software Developer with a strong interest in web development and data visualization. I have
                    created small-scale websites, including a Gym Website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which I
                    developed by exploring and learning from YouTube tutorials. I have also worked on a Power BI
                    project, gaining hands-on experience in building data dashboards and reports. In addition, I am
                    proficient in MS Office tools, which enhance my productivity and presentation skills. I am
                    passionate about continuous learning and aim to grow into a full-stack developer by building more
                    real-world projects and expanding my technical expertise.</div>
                <div class="project-card"><a href="https://karthickag18.github.io/portfolio-website/"><b>Portfolio Website</b></a><br>I created my Portfolio Website
                    using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my skills, education, and projects.During development, I
                    made use of ChatGPT and AI tools to refine content, improve design ideas, and speed up
                    problem-solving. This project reflects my journey as a Junior Software Developer who is continuously
                    learning and building real-world projects to become a Full-Stack Developer.</div>

                            BI-Dashboard</b></a><br>I developed an interactive Sales Dashboard in Power BI using a
                    dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dashboard provides insights into key sales metrics such as total
                    revenue, sales trends, regional performance, and top products. It includes interactive filters and
                    visualizations that make it easy to analyze data and identify patterns. Through this project, I
                    gained hands-on experience in data cleaning, data modeling, DAX calculations, and building dynamic
                    reports. This project helped me strengthen my skills in data visualization and business
                    intelligence, while also learning how to present raw data in a clear and meaningful way.</div>

                    created a User Card Website where each userâ€™s details are displayed in a clean card format. The
                    project is fully built using props, which allowed me to pass dynamic data (like name, role, contact
                    info, etc.) to reusable card components. This helped me practice component-based development and
                    understand how props work for sharing data between components. The website is responsive, simple,
                    and designed for scalability so more user cards can be added easily.</div>
